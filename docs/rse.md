# ICR RSE Community
A Research Software Engineer is someone who develops software for research. 
This includes people who write software to analyse data (including data from simulations), 
develop software to control experiments, run analysis pipelines, and develop software to enable research 
such as databases and visualisation software.  

The ICR RSE Community aims to bring people together who may work individually across different research groups to share expertise and support.
